# Pulsar-Star
 What is a Pulsar Star?

A Pulsar (short for Pulsating Radio Star) is a type of neutron star — the dense, collapsed core left behind after a massive star explodes in a supernova.
Pulsars emit powerful beams of electromagnetic radiation (typically radio waves) from their magnetic poles.
As the star spins, these beams sweep across space like the beams of a lighthouse, and when they point toward Earth, they appear as regular pulses of radiation — hence the name pulsar.

 Importance and Significance of Pulsar Stars

Pulsar stars hold immense scientific importance because of their extreme stability and precision:

 Autonomous Space Navigation (Pulsar-based GPS):
Pulsars can act as natural cosmic lighthouses, allowing spacecraft to navigate autonomously in deep space by measuring the time delays between pulses.
NASA and ESA are already experimenting with pulsar-based navigation systems for interplanetary travel.

 Accurate Time Calculation:
Some pulsars are more stable than atomic clocks.
Their consistent pulse intervals make them ideal for applications in high-precision timekeeping and for studying gravitational waves and black holes.

 Astrophysical Insights:
Studying pulsars helps scientists understand the life cycle of stars, the behavior of matter under extreme gravity, and the nature of the universe’s magnetic fields.

 About the Project

This project aims to detect and classify pulsar stars using machine learning algorithms based on real observational data.
The dataset used (HTRU2) contains features derived from radio emission profiles and DM-SNR curves, which help differentiate real pulsars from noise or false signals.

Key Objectives:

Build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish pulsars from non-pulsars.

Analyze feature distributions and normalize the dataset for accurate training.

Compare performance with Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree models.

Evaluate model accuracy and performance using key classification metrics.

Workflow Summary:

Data Cleaning — handled missing values and stripped unnecessary spaces from column names.

Data Visualization — checked data distribution using Seaborn histograms and KDE plots.

Feature Scaling — applied StandardScaler to normalize features.

Model Training — trained SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers.

Model Evaluation — compared results using accuracy and classification reports.

📈 Results Obtained

After extensive experimentation and model evaluation, the following results were achieved:

Model	Accuracy	Highlights
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	~97–98%	Most effective in identifying pulsars; balanced precision and recall
Decision Tree Classifier	~93%	Good interpretability but slightly prone to overfitting
Naïve Bayes Classifier	~88%	Fast but less accurate due to assumption of feature independence

 The SVM model performed the best overall, achieving high precision and recall, making it a reliable choice for pulsar classification.
